      2. support typescript
      3. multiple framework libraries
      4. angular materials - (UI pages)

	  6. productivity 
	  7. IDEs 
	  8. Testing - jasmine, karmi is the tools 
	  
	 npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
	 
   Angular - Architecture
        Modules - collection of objects (component,services, classes)
        Components - define the task 
			4 files 
				.css - 
				.ts - typescript code
				.specs.ts - testing 
				.html
   		Metadata
			@Component 
				selector 
				templateUrl 
				styleUrl 
		Templates
			integration with the HTML 
			
			<h1> {{"Hi"}} <h1>
		Data binding
			extract the data from the variables
        Directives
			ngIf, ngFor, ngSwitch 
		Services - help in getting the external data (api)
        HttpClient
			extract data from the external resources
		
	AngularJS										Angular
	javascript based front web application			typescript based web appl 
	controller										components
	does not support dynamic loading				dynamic loading of the page
	using HTML pages 								expressions, directives
	does not support server side 					server side programming

Structure angular
	   node_modules - it contains all the libraries which are supported by angular
			npm install
	   src -  modules, component and so on
	   e2e - writing test cases for the UI testing
			Protractor
	   index.html
	   main.ts
	   app - component 
		.html - html element along with the directives, data binding
		.css - styles
		.ts - logic (typescript)
		.specs.ts - unit testing
	  favicon.ico
	   assets - which contains all the images 
	   app.module.ts
	   package.json
       package-lock.json
       angular.json
       .gitignore
	   karma.config.js - unit testing tool for running the test cases
	   test.ts - jasmine framework 
	   style.css
	   tsconfig.json
	   tsconfig.app.json
 
   Binding, Directives, Templates, Components 
   ==================================================================
index.html --> 
main.ts -->which module is going to load --> 
AppModule-->load other module and then load -->
AppComponent
=================================================================
   
   ng g c test
   
   Component
	  4 files
		.ts, specs.ts, .css, .html
		
	String interpolation
		which is used to display the value of a variable 
		   {{variablename}}
	 
    Data Binding
		String interpolation - one binding {{}}
		Event	
			basically used to perform a particular task
			
			different events are (mouseover)
				click
				dbclick
				mouseover
				mouseout
			
		property --[src]
			image want to load the image the src property for the element 
			
		databinding 
			one way
			two way--[(ngModel)]
				value to variable / variable to value

==========		
     Directives
		Component 
			@Component
				
		Structural
		  *ngIf - defining condition (only once)
		  
		  *ngSwitch - switch case statement (multiple cases) 
		  
		  *ngFor - navigate element by element in the array 
		  
		Attribute
			ngClass - class selector css 
			ngStyle - defining a style and apply the css style

	custom template 
		which is used to define a element which can be referred in the else statement of the if 
		
	Angular Material Design
	
    Services
	     the code can be used everywhere in the project. across the components. 
		 can have properties, methods 
		 resuable of code 

31st march
==========		 
      HttpClient - hypertext transfer protocol
		it is used to fetch external data using post, get and so on.
	  HttpModule - access the external data into the service. 	

	  Observable (library - RXJS)
          pass data in sync, async

	Registration page 
	   name, address 
	   
	 Routing
         navigating between the component 
       
     app-routing.module.ts	   
	    
    Forms
	   it is used to handle the user information.

	       used for simple app
			login, registration, change password 
			
		  it can't be scable 
          unstrcutured		  
		   mutable

			more robust, more scalable, resuable, testable.
			reactive patterns 
			structured 
			immutable
			
	Reactive Forms
	
		FormGroup - collection of values from the form control
		FormControl - fetch value and define the individual validation
		FormArray - values in array object
		ControlValueAccessor - create a gap between the element and form control

		dirty - it will return true when the value is changed in the control 
		invalid - will return true if the value is invalid on the control 
		touched - it will return true when the user is visited the control

	Angular 
	binding
	directives 
	components
	modules
	services
	httpclient
	routing 
	material design
	forms 
		template, reactive 
		
	Custom Directives 
     extended functionality of HTML.  
	 
	   directive function
	   
	  Element directive
      Attribute directive

   You will be replacing the component directive with @directive    

   @Directive - configuration property - css attribute selector
    ElementRef - injecting the DOM element 
			using nativeElement property 
    Listener  - handling the events 
	
	<h1 align=left>
	
	Unit Testing 
 Testing
    unit testing is a type of software testing
	where we can test individual components 
	
	a unit may be paritcular to a function, program, etc..
	
	you are testing a piece of code (behaviour of the function or class)
	
	Jasmine test framework
	Karma tool for running the test cases
	
	ng test
	
	.specs.ts (testing file)

    Component interaction 
		Passing value from the parent to the child component 
		
	    @Input 
        @Output 

     @Viewchild
