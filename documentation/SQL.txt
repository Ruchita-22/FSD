		  where condition 
		  
	 relational - >,<,>=,<=,=, <> | !=
   
       mysql> select first_name,email,salary,hire_date from employees
    -> where hire_date > '1998-06-30';


     logical - and, or, not
		mysql> select first_name,department_id,salary from employees
    -> where department_id = 10 or department_id = 20;
	
	mysql> select first_name,salary from employees
    -> where salary > 10000 and salary < 15000;
	
   mysql> select first_name,department_id,salary from employees
    -> where not (department_id = 50 or department_id = 80);
	
     special operators - in, like, between, is 	 
           in - list of value
