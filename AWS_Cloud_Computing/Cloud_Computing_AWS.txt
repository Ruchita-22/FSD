Cloud Computing
AWS 
	- Global Infrastructure
	- Overview of AWS services
	- Demo on EC2, S3, IAM



Virtualization
--------------
Process of creating a virtual version of a computer
- Dedicated amount of CPU, memory and storage

VMware, Oracle Virtual box

Types
	- Desktop Virtualization
	- Network Virtualization
	- Storage Virtualization
	- Apllication Virtualzation


Virtual Machine
	- Is a computer file - Image
	- virtual representation of a physical system



Hypervisor:
	software that create and runs virtauls machines

	type 1
		- Directly on hardware


	microsoft hyper v


	Type 2
		- run inside the OS
		 Oracle Virtual box



Cloud Computing
----------------

- Delivery of computing services like servers, storage, networking, software analytics to the end users over the interbnet

- On Demand
- Pay as go model
- Shared resources


resources
	- Compute
	- Storage
	- Network
	- Analytics



Benefits
	- Cost Efficient
		- Opex
			- Predict Cost	

	- Scaling /Elasticity
		- consume on demand
		- scale up or down

	- High Availibility / Global Reach
		- Deploy globally in mins

	- Disaster Recovery

	- Agility
		- using advanced technologies
		- Spin up infra on demand

	- Security









On Premise
	- Capex is High
	- Maintenance
	.....


Models

	- Deployment models
		- Public Clouds
		- private Clouds
		- hybrid Cloud 


AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform


Niche
	- IBM
	- Alibaba Cloud
	- Digital Ocean
	- Sales force



- Service Models
	Iaas
		- rent infra like servers, Vm, Storage network
	Paas
		- Dev to build and host your applications
	Saas -
		Office365
	Faas
		- Serverless application


	Daas- Database as a sevice








AWS - Amazon Web Services

	- Broadly Adopted
	- Global Datacenters
	- Lots of services - 175+


AWS Global Infrastructure
----------------------

Avalibility Zones - Collection of datacenters

Region - Collection of AZ 


Edge Locations
-------------
	
- Datacenter near the end users
- CloudFront


AWS Compute Services
--------------------
    
    - Amazon EC2 - Elastic Comput cloud - EC2
        instance with resizable capacity( cpu, memory, storage)
        - instance types
            - AMI Amazon Machine image
   
    - AWS Elastic Bean Stalk
        - Platforms for scaling and deploy web applications 
        - Support a list of techs
        - Handles provisioning, scaling load balancing etc
    
    - AWS Lambda
        - compute without managing servers
        - enables event driven architecture


ECS (Elastic Container service)
EKS( Elastic Kubernetes service)



Accessing AWS
-------------

- AWS Management console - GUI
- AWS CLI



 Elastic Compute Cloud - EC2
        - Vitual Machine with storage in a vpc (virtual private network)

 - AMI - Machine images

  https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/
 - EC2 instance types
    - general purpose
    - Compute optimized
    - memory optimized

- Storage
  - EBS (Elastic Block store)
    - like a network drive
    - one or more EBS drives
    - delete on termination
    - scoped in a region

- EFS Elastic file
    - scoped in multiple regions


- VPC
  - virtual private network
  - partition
      - public subnet
      - private subnet

- Security groups
  - configure network security
  - Inbound and outbound rules 
  
  
  Connecting to Instance
  -----------------------

  connect with ssh 
  make your key pair file private

  ssh -i "aws_ec2_demo.pem" ec2-user@ec2-xxxxxx3.compute-1.amazonaws.com


  sudo yum install httpd
  sudo systemctl start httpd

  /var/www/html  index.html


Using User Data:

#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "<h1> Server Address : $(hostname) </h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html


Secure Copy
-----------
scp -i "test.pem" c:/fl1/file1.txt   ec2-user@ec2-3-82-150-140.compute-1.amazonaws.com:~/data


Elastic Load Balancer
---------------------

Application LB - http, https
Network LB - TCP


IAM - Identity Access Management
--------------------------------

- Control access to resources
- Authentication



IAM Principal
-------------
Root user
User
Groups 
	- Collection of Permissions

Role:
	- Permission of AWS services


Policies:
	- Defines the permission
	- Attached to identity/resource
	- JSON document



AWS provide lots of standard policies - Managed Policies


Storage Services in AWS
===========================

S3(Simple storage service)
--------------------------

- Object Storage
- Storage Classes 
- Versioning
- encrytion
- Security - Access 
	- IAM based
	- Resource based policies
		- bucket policy

-Buckets - Container to store objects(files)


Create a static Website in S3. 


EBS
---
- Attaching to EC2
- like network drives

Volumes
	- SSD
		- Provisioned IOPs
		- General purpose
	- HDD
		Throuput optimized


AWS Snowball

AWS EFS



 - AWS Elastic Bean Stalk
        - Platforms for scaling and deploy web applications 
        - Support a list of techs
        - Handles provisioning, scaling load balancing etc






Route 53
---------
-- DNS service
- IP with Domain by creating a A record
- Buy a domain
- Routing and filtering


CloudWatch
----------
Monitoring and observability

CloudFormation
--------------
- Infrastructure as code
- Define template in JSOn/YAML and create resources on AWS using Cloudformation




Integration services
---------------------


SNS - Simple notification service
================================

Producer --- Topic -- consumers
			   --

Push Notification


SQS - Simple Queue service
==========================

Producer write to 	Queue  <---- Consumer polls the queue for messages

Pull Service
